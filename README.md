# Adaptive Oversight Checkpoint Placement with Near-Miss Learning

**US Provisional Patent Application**

## Overview
A system for optimally placing human oversight checkpoints in autonomous AI agent workflows using risk-budget optimization, with a near-miss learning mechanism that improves checkpoint placement over time based on observed agent behavior.

## Key Innovations
- Risk scoring framework (Impact × Breadth × Probability) with configurable risk budgets
- Algorithmic checkpoint placement (greedy, dynamic programming, ILP) over sequential and DAG workflows
- Near-miss taxonomy (7 types) with severity-weighted learning and temporal decay
- Compound action aggregation to prevent risk-budget circumvention

## Status
- **Filed:** US Provisional Patent Application (2026)
- **Inventor:** Hunter Spence

---

## BEFORE YOU FILE

### 1. Record Your Public Disclosure Date
Your repos were briefly public on Feb 27, 2026. Screenshot the GitHub commit history showing timestamps. Save these — they prove the grace period clock.

**US Grace Period: 1 year from Feb 27, 2026 = deadline Feb 27, 2027**
File ASAP — don't wait.

### 2. Confirm Micro-Entity Status
You qualify if ALL of these are true:
- [ ] You haven't been named as inventor on more than 4 previously filed US patent applications
- [ ] Your gross income last year was less than 3x the US median household income (~$234,000)
- [ ] You haven't assigned/obligated the patent to an entity that exceeds micro-entity limits

If YES to all → $65/provisional
If NO → small entity at $130/provisional

## AFTER FILING

### Immediate:
- Save all filing receipts and application numbers
- Store copies of everything submitted
- You are now "Patent Pending" ✅

### Within 12 months (by ~Feb 2027):
- Decide whether to convert each provisional to a non-provisional ($400 each, micro-entity)
- If you don't convert, the provisional expires and you lose the priority date
- You can let weak ones expire and only convert strong ones

### If converting to non-provisional:
- You'll need formal patent claims (I can draft these)
- USPTO will examine the application (takes 2-4 years)
- If granted → you have an enforceable US patent for 20 years

## IMPORTANT REMINDERS

- ⚠️ DO NOT make repos public again until after filing
- ⚠️ DO NOT discuss the inventions publicly before filing
- ⚠️ Each provisional must be self-contained (enable the full invention independently)
- ⚠️ Provisional does NOT require formal claims, but the description must be detailed enough to support future claims
- ✅ AI-drafted applications are legal (USPTO Nov 2025 guidance). You are the inventor.
- ✅ You can file all 3 in one sitting on PatentCenter
